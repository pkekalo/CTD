# Welcome to class!  We're glad to have you in our program!  

## First let's look around at where we are...

### Where am I?
The site you're at is replit.com.  They are an online integrated development environment.  Wow!  That's a bunch of words!  Let's unpack that... An "Integrated Development Environment" (called an IDE for short because that's a huge name) is a space developers use to have all their tools visible at once and easy to jump between so they can work quickly and effectively.  Replit runs through your internet browser window which makes it an _online_ IDE.  Later in class you'll download, install, and use a software program that is an IDE that runs whether you're using your internet browser or not.

### Replit Interface
What's an interface?  It's a place where a user interacts with a piece of techonology.  There are a few main areas in within this replit interface.

The **Files** area to the left shows an index.js file and this "readme" file. For this exercise you only need to work with and edit code within the index.js file.

The **Editor** section in the middle (where you're reading this at) is where you will be editing the index.js file. One thing that will likely look different from a normal text editor or word editor is that different portions of the code will be colored in different ways. This is called *Syntax Highlighting* and is useful when working in a code file to quickly identify the different parts of the code.

The **Console** section on the right is where you will see output from any console.log code you write to test your code. For right now, it's just a panel that shows you the some option buttons and the name and author of this work. After you read the rest of this page, you'll fork the assignment (instructions below) and will see the console log in place of the information panel. There are further details in the index.js on the console.logs, how/where to use them, and how to run your code, as well as more details below.

The **Shell** section (the tab next to Console in the panel to the right) will not be needed, so you can close it by clicking the X on that tab anytime.

## Instructions
You'll need to fork this code to get started, but don't do it yet!  Let's talk about what it means to fork code. Forking means making your own personal copy of a code base. Because your forked copy is _your_ copy, you can write your code without other people also using the code base seeing your answers and work.  You can also go back to your assignments and make any edits or review your work at any time. For the next several weeks you'll fork the coding assignment for each week of class to make your own copy.  You can find your copies of these assignments by clicking on the profile icon (small circle next to the bell) in the top right of this website, then select "Profile".  On the Profile page you should have a folder on the left called "My Repls" that is highlighted.  If it isn't highlighted, click on the folder once and it will show you all your worksheets. You should also be sure to disable AI automations. As we discussed in orientation and/or Office Hours before class began, there's a time and place for AI automations, but writing code as a beginner isn't one of them. To disable AI automations, follow these steps:

1. In the bottom left corner you'll see "Tools". Scroll to the bottom of that section and click on "User Settings". This will open a new window in the pane on the right (where your Console is).
2. In the User Settings pane on the right that opened, scroll down to "AI code completion" and toggle the switch from blue/on to gray/off
3. Done!

**NOTE:** You can also click the small "AI" icon on the bottom left of a file in the editor pane and uncheck the AI Autocomplete checkbox there.

### Opening and Running Index.js
If index.js is not already a tab available here in the Editor part of the interface after you fork the assignment, double click on the index.js file name in the Files panel on the left to open it.  When you write code in the index.js file, the code will not run until you have saved (or until your file autosaved) and you click the green "Run" button at the top of the webpage.  The results of running your code will be seen in the Console pane to the right.  If your code runs and runs and eventually gives you an error or time out message, you may have an infinite loop in your code so double check your code.

### Debugging
Not many people like bugs, and in code, you don't want many - if any - bugs. Bugs can cause your code to NOT run as you expect or want.  We call checking for these kinds of issues in your code and fixing them "debugging". You should use `console.log` to output values in the code when it is run to assist in debugging. For example, if you are having an issue with something related to the `firstName` variable you might add this line of code right below the variable to see what the actual value is at that point `console.log('firstName variable is: ', firstName)`.  Then run the file by clicking the Run button and looking at the output in the **Console**.  We have console.log code written for your first few questions so you can see what to do.  Be sure you follow that pattern for all of the other questions.

### Getting help
Refer to your lessons materials, contact class mentors, or reach out to your cohort leader(s) if you need any help.  Happy coding!

## Now you're ready to get started! Click the "Fork" button to the right under the big green "Run" button to make a copy of this starter code for yourself.  When the window opens, rename the assignment to "_Your Name Here_ - Lesson 1" and then click the blue Fork button.
